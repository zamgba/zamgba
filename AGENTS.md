# Zamgba Agent Guidelines

This document provides essential context for AI agents working in the `zamgba` repository.

## Project Overview
Zamgba is a self-learning project for Game Boy Advance (GBA) programming using the **Zig** programming language (targeting Zig version **0.16.0** or later). It contains a library SDK (`zamgba`), a Hardware Abstraction Layer (`zamgba-hal`), platform-agnostic 2D graphics helper routines (`zamgba-engine`), and example demo ROMs.

## Code Architecture & File Layout

- **`build.zig` / `build.zig.zon`**: Build configuration. Defines target CPU (`arm7tdmi`), optimization modes, exposes `zamgba` module dependencies, and exports build helpers for consumers.
- **`src/zamgba.zig`**: The main entry point module for client integration, exposing `hal` and `engine`.
- **`src/build/arm.zig`**: Build scripts helper functions (`addROM`, `addStaticLibrary`) that set up the correct cross-compilation target query (`thumb`, `arm7tdmi`, `freestanding`) and post-compile step (`objcopy`) to generate `.gba` binary.
- **`src/hal/`** (Hardware Abstraction Layer):
  - `hal.zig`: Core HAL file. Defines memory sections (VRAM, EWRAM, IWRAM, IORAM, etc.), screen dimensions (Mode 3, Mode 5), default color constants, boot logic (`_start`, `_boot`), and ROM header setup tools.
  - `gba.ld`: The custom linker script defining the memory layout for the GBA (mapping `.gba.header`, `.gba.start`, `.gba.boot`, `.gba.main` sections to the beginning of the text area in `pakrom`).
  - `header.zig`: Structure definition and template for GBA ROM headers.
  - `display.zig`: Safe wrappers for GBA display controls (`REG_DISPCNT`, `REG_DISPSTAT`, `REG_VCOUNT`), register reading/writing, and page flipping.
  - `context.zig`: Hardware-backed bitmap drawing contexts (e.g., `Mode3Context`, `Mode5Context`) wrapping raw VRAM with bounds checks.
- **`src/engine/gfx2d/`** (2D Graphics Algorithms):
  - `gfx2d.zig`: Exposes drawing helpers.
  - `line.zig` / `point.zig`: Implementation of generic drawing algorithms (e.g. Bresenham's line algorithm via `drawLine`) designed to be context-agnostic.
- **`demo/first.zig`**: Entry point for the sample ROM demonstration using Mode 3 context to draw colored lines.
- **`src/unittest.zig`**: Root file for compiling unit tests.

## Essential Commands

- **Build**: `zig build`
  - Generates standard ELF binaries with debugging symbols (e.g., `zig-out/bin/first`).
  - Generates GBA-compatible ROM binaries (e.g., `zig-out/bin/first.gba`) using `objcopy` (.bin output format).
- **Test**: `zig build test`
  - Runs unit tests defined in the files imported by `src/unittest.zig`.
  - **Crucial Gotcha**: Unit tests compile and execute on the **host machine**. Manipulation of hardware registers (`REG_DISPCNT`, etc.) will not execute correctly on the host. Tests must mock drawing contexts or test purely logic-based structures.
- **Run**: `mgba ./zig-out/bin/first.gba`
  - Runs the compiled GBA ROM on the mGBA emulator.
- **Debug**: `mgba -d ./zig-out/bin/first.gba`
  - Starts mGBA with assembly-level GDB debugging support.

## Gotchas and Important Patterns

### 1. Boot Entry and Calling Conventions
- **Naked Function Requirement**: The low-level boot sequence entry point `_start` in `src/hal/hal.zig` must use `callconv(.naked)`. 
- **Why**: As of Zig 0.16.0, the compiler strictly emits standard ABI prologues (which push registers onto uninitialized stacks) for normal exported functions. Since `_start` runs before the stack is even set up, normal function prologues will cause a silent hardware/emulator crash (rendering a blank white screen). Using `callconv(.naked)` prevents the compiler from adding stack management prologues.
- **Prior Versioning**: Older Zig versions used `.Naked`. In 0.16.0+, only `.naked` is valid.

### 2. GBA Boot Logic Assembly Workaround
- **Inline Assembly Branch**: The boot logic in `_boot()` intentionally uses inline assembly (`asm volatile`) rather than Zig's built-in compile-time checks (e.g. `@hasDecl(root, "main")`) to call the user's `main()` function. 
- **Why**: `@hasDecl` is evaluated at compile time and caused an endless loop during boot under certain target configurations. **Do not refactor the boot sequence to use `@hasDecl`**.

### 3. Register Access and Unit Testing
- **Avoid Register Writes in Tests**: GBA hardware register writing functions (such as `display.writeRegister()` which writes directly to `0x04000000`) must **never** be invoked in unit tests.
- **Pattern**: When testing components like `display`, only verify their software-side state (e.g., checking `display.value`). Avoid writing to or reading from actual volatile pointers when executed on host test machines.

### 4. Client Integration Requirements
To successfully use Zamgba in an external/client project:
1. **Target Hook**: The client's `build.zig` must use `@import("zamgba").arm.addROM(...)` to construct the freestanding target, apply the linker script (`gba.ld`), and invoke `objcopy`.
2. **Explicit ROM Header Registration**: The client must explicitly expose a static `export var gameHeader linksection(".gba.header") = hal.setupROMHeader(...)` variable so that the GBA BIOS can validate and boot the ROM.
3. **Noreturn Main Function**: The client must define an exported `export fn main() noreturn` function ending in an infinite loop (`while (true) {}`), as the GBA has no operating system to return execution to.

## Agent Behavior & Communication Rules

- **Documentation**: All code comments, READMEs, and guides must be written in English.
- **Design Documents**: Architectural guidelines are listed in the `docs/` folder. Always consult `compile.md` and `features.md` before making modifications to compiling/linking rules or features planning.
- **Communication Style**: Direct and to the point. No conversational filler, pleasantries, or emojis.

### Demo Guidelines
- When adding a new demo, place the newly added demo ROM to the corresponding subfolder inside `demo/` (e.g., `demo/hal/` for hardware-abstraction layer demos).
